My name is Antonis Geralis. I am an engineering student.
I speak ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· Greek (native), ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² English and ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German. I code mostly in [Nim](nim-lang.org/). My programming interests include multithreading, fuzzing, traffic simulations, games and web-apps. I love solving hard problems and learning about Computer Science.

### Software

Some of the most interesting software projects I've authored are:

| Name | Description |
| :-: | --- |
| [drchaos](https://github.com/status-im/nim-drchaos) | A powerful and easy-to-use fuzzing framework in Nim for C/C++/Obj-C targets. |
| [libfuzzer](https://github.com/planetis-m/libfuzzer) | Thin interface for libFuzzer, an in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing engine. |
| [eminim](https://github.com/planetis-m/eminim) | JSON serialization framework, works from a Stream directly to any type and back. |
| [manu](https://github.com/planetis-m/manu) | A linear algebra library in pure Nim. Supports constructing and manipulating real, dense matrices. |
| [sync](https://github.com/planetis-m/sync) |  Useful synchronization primitives |
| [bingo](https://github.com/planetis-m/bingo) |  Binary serialization framework |
| [goodluck](https://github.com/planetis-m/goodluck) | A hackable template for creating small and fast games. Nim port |
