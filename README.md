### Î“ÎµÎ¹Î± ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antonis Geralis. I am an engineering student.
I speak ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· Greek (native), ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² English and ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German. I code mostly in [Nim](nim-lang.org/). My programming interests include multithreading, fuzzing, traffic simulations, games and web-apps. I love solving hard problems and learning about Computer Science.

### Software

Some of the most interesting software projects I've authored are:

| Name | Description |
| :-: | --- |
| [libfuzzer](https://github.com/planetis-m/libfuzzer) | Thin interface for libFuzzer, an in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing engine. |
| [eminim](https://github.com/planetis-m/eminim) | JSON serialization framework, works from a Stream directly to any type and back. |
| [manu](https://github.com/planetis-m/manu) | A linear algebra library in pure Nim. Supports constructing and manipulating real, dense matrices. |
| [sync](https://github.com/planetis-m/sync) |  Useful synchronization primitives |
| [bingo](https://github.com/planetis-m/bingo) |  Binary serialization framework  |
| [goodluck](https://github.com/planetis-m/goodluck) | A hackable template for creating small and fast games. Nim port |
| [naylib](https://github.com/planetis-m/naylib) | Yet another raylib wrapper |
| [packedjson2](https://github.com/planetis-m/packedjson2) | Efficient JSON implementation. The tree is essentially a seq of nodes. Based on planetis-m/jsonecs#8 |
| [patgraph](https://github.com/planetis-m/patgraph) | Efficient graph data structure library. The graph is a seq of nodes plus a seq of edges. |
| [ssostrings](https://github.com/planetis-m/ssostrings) | Small String Optimized (SSO) string implementation |
| [cowstrings](https://github.com/planetis-m/cowstrings) | Copy-On-Write string implementation according to nim-lang/RFCs#221 |
| [html2karax](https://github.com/nim-lang-cn/html2karax) | Converts static HTML to Karax. |
| [neuralnet-examples](https://github.com/planetis-m/neuralnet-examples) | Neural network examples |
| [protocoled](https://github.com/planetis-m/protocoled) | Interface macro |
| [fusion/astdsl](https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion) | A DSL for convenient construction of Nim ASTs |
